| <b>The Intel速 Smart Edge Open Developer Experience Kit installation workflow</b>

## System requirements

You will need two machines:

- **A provisioning system:** where you run the Edge Software Provisioner to build a bootable image of the experience kit.

- **A target system:** where you install the bootable image to create an edge cluster.

> **Note:** You must add the provisioning system's user account to `/etc/sudoers` for installation to succeed.

### Provisioning system 

The provisioning system must meet the following specifications:

- At least 4 GB RAM 
- At least 20 GB hard drive
- USB flash drive
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Internet access
  
### Target system 

Below are the minimum requirements for running the Developer Experience Kit. See the full specs for the [supported hardware](https://github.com/smart-edge-open/docs/blob/main/release-notes/release-notes-se-open-DEK-21-12.md). 

- A server with two 3rd Generation Intel速 Xeon速 Scalable Processors
- At least 32 GB RAM 
- Two SATA SSDs
- Two NICs 
- Connection to the provisioning system

> **NOTE:** The provisioning process will install Ubuntu 20.04 LTS on the target machine. Any existing operating system will be overwritten.
